A test module to measure irq latency on the Overo running Linux.

Jumper GPIO_146 to GPIO_147 but hook an oscope probe to do the 
measurement between them.


GPIO_146 ---- TP ---- GPIO_147
               |
            oscope


Build the module, insert it and then write something to 
/dev/irqlat like

echo 1 > /dev/irqlat

It doesn't matter what you write, it's ignored.

But watch the rise and fall of the signal. That's the irq latency
of the system. At least as far as I can tell.

If I did something wrong, let me know.
